[.text-left]
==== Available Out of the Box:
* Collections/streams
* Classes/records
** Records by themselves are great
** Better DOP support in the latest versions of Java - instanceof pattern matching, switch pattern matching, sealed types, etc.
* Maps

==== Drawbacks
* Memory overhead
** Byte count goes here <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
* Lacks cohesion
* Brittle
* Map Oriented Programming - “the horror... the horror...”
