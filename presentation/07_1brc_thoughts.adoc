* Pretty amazing!
** Top 3 results: 1.535, 1.587, and 1.608 seconds
** Reference environment: 8 cores, 128 GB RAM
* Most submissions
** Are many hundreds of lines of (well formatted and well factored) code
** Have fairly helpful comments (well, some)
** Use advanced Java optimization techniques, Vector API, low level APIs, the latest language features, the latest JVM features, and dark magic
** Require top expertise and intimate understanding of the JVM and the compiler behavior from the developer
** Required a good amount of the developer’s time (spent both writing and reading the code).
** Do not make it obvious how the algorithms work/what exactly they do due to the solution complexity

*This makes sense in the context of the challenge and by itself doesn’t make these solutions “bad code”. +
Achieving absolute peak performance demands the above “sacrifices”.*
