== Data Oriented vs. Object Oriented

[.text-center]
==== Data/State
[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
* Take my state. Please.
** Just data as records, tables, collections
** Data is immutable
|
* State? What state?
** Protect your privates
** Data is Encapsulated
|===

[.text-center]
==== Operations
[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
* Standalone functions operating on data
** Methods are exception (very simple behavior on data elements)
* `if`/`switch` statements in lieu of polymorphism
|
* Objects responding to messages
** Implemented as methods
* Polymorphism allows objects of different types to respond to the same message
|===

[.text-center]
==== Good For
[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
* Experimentation, exploration, ad hoc calculation
* Separating business logic from data
** E.g. a business user facing application, logic needs to be user defined and externalized
* Flexible data models
|
* Managing complexity of domain structure and behavior
* Managing change
* Taking advantage of OO language features (polymorphism, inheritance)
* Taking advantage of OO modeling techniques
