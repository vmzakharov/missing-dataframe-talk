"Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is deceptively simple: write a Java program for retrieving temperature measurement values from a text file and calculating the min, mean, and max temperature per weather station. Thereâ€™s just one caveat: the file has 1,000,000,000 rows!"
-- Gunnar Morling (@gunnarmorling), "The One Billion Row Challenge"
