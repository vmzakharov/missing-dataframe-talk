# missing-dataframe-talk
presentation materials and code for the "Missing DataFrame" talk

## Abstract
There is a missing tool in your Java data structure toolkit â€“ DataFrames!

Java developers are well versed in the Java Collections Framework (JCF), but the JCF requires predefined types and operates at a low level of abstraction.

DataFrames offer Java developers a competitive alternative to Python/Pandas and Scala/Spark. DataFrames give you the ability to easily transform and organize data in code, while providing efficiency, flexibility, code readability, and developer productivity. DataFrames are used in real-world scenarios such as data transformation, data enrichment, data validation, and reconciliation.

Join this talk and discover how DataFrames can elevate your Java programming experience!
